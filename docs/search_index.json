["index.html", "(Re)Doing Bayesain Data Analysis 1 What’s in These Notes", " (Re)Doing Bayesain Data Analysis R Pruim 2019-01-07 1 What’s in These Notes This “book” is a companion to Kruschke’s Doing Bayesian Data Analysis. The main reasons for this companion are to use a different style of R code that includes: use of modern packages like tidyverse, R2jags, bayesplot, and ggformula; adherence to a different style guide; less reliance on manually editing scripts and more use of resusable code available in packages; a workflow that takes advantage of RStudio and RMarkdown. This is a work in progress. Please accept my apologies in advance for errors, inconsistencies lack of complete coverage But feel free to post issues on github if you spot things that require attention or care to make suggestions for improvement. I’ll be teaching from this book in Spring 2019, so I expect rapid development during those months. "]
